# Probability and Statistics

### **Why do we need probability for Data Science?**

Learning probability helps in making informed decisions about likelihood of events, based on a pattern of collected data. In the context of data science, statistical inferences are often used to analyze or predict trends from data and these inferences use probability distributions of data. Using probability, we can model elements of uncertainty such as risk in financial transactions and many other business processes such as risk evaluation, sales forecasting, market research etc.

### **Terminology**

The basic terms related to probability are as follows:

- _Experiment_: an action where the result is uncertain even though all the possible outcomes related to it are known in advance.

- _Outcome_: a possible result of an experiment or trial.

- _Sample space_: the set of all possible outcomes associated with a random experiment.

- _Event_: a subset of sample space or the single result of an experiment.

- _Mutually exclusive events_: two events are mutually exclusive if the probability of occurrence of both events simultaneously is zero.

- _Dependent events_: two events are dependent if the occurrence of the first affects the occurrence of the second, so the probability is changed.

- _Independent events_: two events are independent if occurring or non-occurring of one does not affect the occurring or non-occurring of a second.

- _Random variable_: a numerical quantity that is generated by a random experiment.

- _Discrete random variable_: a random variable having either a finite or a countable number of possible values.

- _Continuous random variable_: a random variable having a whole interval of numbers of possible values.

- _Probability mass function_: a probability function associated with a discrete random variable.

- _Probability density function_: a probability function associated with a continuous random variable.

- _Joint distributions_: the joint probability distribution for X, Y,.. is a probability distribution that gives the probability that each of X, Y,.. falls in any particular range or discrete set of values specified for that variable.
